Topic: Physics Engine

â€‹       Use a physics engine to create a world and the objects in them. 

- Integrate the physics engine with the p5 code to create interactive objects following the rules of physics in this world. 
- Tune the physics engine to change the behavior of the objects in your world.

We are going to learn a few more necessary details which we would need to use when we finally start designing angry birds game. 

* When we create each object in the game, each of it must follow the rules of physics (nature) - like gravity, bounceoff, collision detection etc.

* We can create each object and give these properties to each object we create. And then we can program how each object should interact with another. 

  * * But such a program would get quite difficult to write and manage?

    * Developers have worked on this problem before and created a library. 

    * The library helps us create a world where all the objects follow the rules of physics which we define for them.

      So, whenever an object is created, it already has bounce off, collision detection, gravity and many other properties.

      * We call such a library - a physics engine. We can change the behavior of the objects in this world by tuning our physics engine.

        We will be making the Angry Birds Game using such a physics engine. 

        * There are many different kinds of libraries for the physics engine in javascript.
        *   Some of the popular ones are **box2d, matter.js, p2.js**. 
        * In our projects, we will be using matter.js as our **Physics engine.**

        \* Let's create a **Ground** using the **physics engine**. To use the physics engine, we will use **three objects created in Matter.js** library -> **World, Engine and Bodies.**

        * **Engine** is used to create the physics engine.

        * * **World** is used to create the physical world and add objects to it. 

          * * **Bodies** is used to create the physical objects which inhabit the world. * Since these objects are a part of Matter library, they are referenced as **Matter.World, Matter.Engine and Matter.Bodies.** 

            * * Let's rename them as World, Engine and Bodies so that it is easy to write and read our code. This is called **namespacing** in programming. 

              * ###### * **const** is just like var - except you cannot change the value stored in a const anywhere in your program.
